The problem was the missing documentation of the change. I implemented a
work-around once I figured out the reason why my code didn't work
anymore.

The problem is, I'm not particularly fond of sprinkling my code with
if-statements checking for version incompatibilities. 

BTW, there seems to be another change in version 19.30 concerning
find-file-hook. I use find-file-hook to update some buffer-local
variables. Starting with 19.30 my code didn't work. I found a hack
around this, too, but that one is rather annoying: the function called
by find-file-hook sets a temporary post-command-hook to do its
work. At least, this hack works for 19.28 as well.
